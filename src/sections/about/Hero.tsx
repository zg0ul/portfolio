            I'm Mohammad Zgoul, I go by zg0ul online, an engineer passionate
            about bridging AI, hardware, and software to build meaningful
            technology. My journey has taken me through developing computer
            vision systems, geospatial AI solutions, assistive tech, and
            full-stack applications. I enjoy approaching problems from multiple
            angles, drawing on my background in machine learning, Python,
            Flutter, and Next.js. Right now, I'm focused on Flutter development,
            constantly learning and aiming to create solutions that make a real
            difference.
